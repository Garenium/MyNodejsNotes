/*
 * Having global functions with the same name is not 
ideal because they will be overwritten.

var sayHello = function(){
    //anything
}

window.sayHello();



That's where modules come in.

 * Modules are like boxes that have (encapsulate)
js files to tell them apart
Modules are now common because people treat JS 
more than a scripting language
Modules are used to tell js files apart
There are different types of modules 
But for nodejs, CommonJS module is used by default

Modules are really just like encapsulation in an OOP sense
(private, public, protected etc.)
